# Whatâ€™s XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into trusted websites. 
These scripts are executed in the context of the victim's browser, potentially stealing sensitive information like cookies, session tokens, or personal data.

# Types of XXS

1- Stored XSS: Malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and served to users later.
2- Reflected XSS: Malicious script is part of the request (e.g., URL parameters) and is reflected in the response.
3- DOM-based XSS: Malicious script is executed due to client-side manipulation of the DOM.
